# Liquefaction LPI and LSN Calculator

This project provides a standalone desktop application for calculating **Liquefaction Potential Index (LPI)** and **Liquefaction Severity Number (LSN)** based on geotechnical data such as SPT, CPT, and site-specific parameters.

It is designed for geotechnical engineers, researchers, and students to streamline the assessment of soil liquefaction potential in seismic-prone regions. The app is built with **PyQt6** and packaged as an executable for easy deployment.
